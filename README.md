  # JSON-Based Chatbot

This project is a simple chatbot implementation in Python, using a JSON file to store questions and responses. The chatbot reads the user's input, looks for matching questions in the JSON file, and provides an appropriate response. If it doesn't understand the input, it returns a default fallback message.
